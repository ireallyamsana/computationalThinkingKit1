# Computional Thinking Kit1

In this computational thinking kit, all the .html files use the same design by sharing one css file (ct.css). The explanation of each web is as followed:

factorial.html : an algorithm that receives a positive number, as n, and outputs n! (n Factorial)

fibonacciSequence: an algorithm that inputs an integer greater than 1, as n, and outputs the first n values of the Fibonacci sequence  

numOfSevens: an algorithm that receives a positive number and outputs how many of its digits are equal to 7

reversibleNum: an algorithm that receives a positive number and outputs "yes" if it's equal to its reverse; otherwise, outputs "no"

sumOfDigsOfPosInts: an algorithm that receives a positive number and outputs sum of its digits
